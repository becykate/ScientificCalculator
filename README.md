# ScientificCalculator
My Scientific Calculator Project!
This project is a functional scientific calculator that I have made using Python 3 and Tkinter on PyCharm.
To make this project, I made use of an online tutorial and my own problem solving skills following the completion of my Python 3 course. 
I worked solo during the project, and used the tutorial as a safety net and source of guidance on methods I hadn't used or encountered. 
This is my first completed solo project, and first project using Python, and I am very proud of it.
I build upon the methods in the tutorial by adding extra aspects and effects, such as sound effects upon interaction with buttons, and an exit button within
the calculator itself. 

The tutorial used can be found at this address: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5g-gnHlLIA&t=113s!
